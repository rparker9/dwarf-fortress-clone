# dwarf-fortress-clone
Here I attempt to build a complex simulation game like Dwarf Fortress of Caves of Qud in Unity 6. This will involve many interlocking systems—from procedural world generation and simulation ticks to managing thousands of entities with their own behaviors. The game runs on a “tick” system where the entire world updates at regular intervals. This tick is where you update your simulation—moving entities, processing events, and updating the world state. I want to take a data driven approach to developing this project. I'm most familiar with object oriented programming, but from experience I believe an Entity-Component Pattern would be more well-suited to this task. Keep in mind, I do NOT want to use unity's DOTS system. I don't want to use their ECS system. I just want to follow the data-driven, entity-component design system/programming pattern. I'll need to develop Entity & Behavior Systems for my simulated entities and design behavior routines, an event system that can trigger, schedule, and manage events (including pathfinding, decision trees, or state machines). I'll need to break these systems down into manageable components to help in testing allows me to expand functionality without reworking everything over and over. Here I start building a minimum viable simulation loop that processes simple actions (like moving entities) and gradually add complexity. I'm inspired by the work of Bob Nystrom and Brian Bucklew and Jason Grinblat
